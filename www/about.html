  <h1>About Storm Bar</h1>

  <h2>What is it?</h2>
  <p>Do you use a Desktop launch bar on your computer. Maybe Alfred, Quicksilver or something similar? Well Storm Bar is just like that but built for the web.</p>
  <p>Imagine a launch bar for the web that has a documented public JavaScript based API where extensions are simply URLs. This is Storm Bar.</p>

  <h2>Who made it?</h2>
  <p>Storm Bar started life as a Forward hack day project by Andy Kent, Nick Daniels &amp; Mike Sheppard. It was originally coded in 8 hours.</p>
