  <h1>About Storm Bar</h1>

  <h2>What is it?</h2>
  <p>Do you use a Desktop launch bar on your computer? Maybe Alfred, Quicksilver or something similar? Well Storm Bar is just like that but built for the web.</p>
  <p>Imagine a launch bar for the web that has a documented public JavaScript based API where extensions are simply URLs. This is Storm Bar.</p>

  <h2>Who made it?</h2>
  <p>Storm Bar started life as a Forward hack day project by Andy Kent, Nick Daniels &amp; Mike Sheppard. It was originally coded in 8 hours but has since been re-written.</p>

  <h2>Where will it work?</h2>
  <p>Storm Bar is tested as working on the latest versions of Chrome & Safari on Desktop and Mobile. Firefox & IE10 support is coming soon.</p>

  <h2>Are you spying on me?</h2>
  <p>Storm Bar is comprised of entirely static files. We don't use cookies or track your usage but we do use Local Storage to keep track of installed bolts, configuration and history. Currently none of this data leaves your machine.</p>
